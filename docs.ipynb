    "## **Comparison and Results - Speech-to-Text**\n",
    "The comparison involved conducting three separate recordings, each designed to represent different aspects of a conversation one might have with WALI. These recordings were then transcribed using multiple speech-to-text technologies to assess their performance.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For **streaming transcription**, the **final transcript** was tracked in real time as the recording progressed, ensuring that the transcription reflected the spoken words without post-processing.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For **Faster Whisper**, two different model sizes—**small** and **medium**—were implemented. These models transcribed the recordings after completion, allowing for a comparison of accuracy and processing speed between them.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure consistency across all transcription methods, **all audio files were recorded at a fixed sample rate of 48 kHz**. A sample rate of 48 kHz means that the audio signal was captured **48,000 times per second**, providing a higher resolution of sound, which can improve transcription accuracy by preserving more details of the speech.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For **streaming transcription**, a **FRAMES_PER_BUFFER** value of **4096** was used. This parameter determines the number of audio frames processed at a time before being sent for transcription. A larger buffer size like 4096 helps balance real-time performance with stability by reducing the number of small, frequent transmissions, which can be computationally expensive, while still allowing for near-instantaneous transcription.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Both **Faster Whisper** models ran on **CUDA**, which enabled GPU acceleration for faster processing. This allowed the models to handle speech-to-text conversion more efficiently than a CPU, improving speed while maintaining accuracy.  \n",
    "\n",
    "By analyzing the results across these different transcription methods, the study evaluates their performance in terms of **accuracy, latency, and real-time capability**.  \n",
